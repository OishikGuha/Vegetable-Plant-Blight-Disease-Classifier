# Vegetable-Plant-Blight-Disease-Classifier.
This is an ML-Powered Project I'm working on which can, for now, classify what kind of blight disease a tomato/potato plant has.

## How to run
### Installing main dependencies:

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your OS.

`$ pip install tensorflow keras tensorflow-nightly`

*For installing node modules*

`$ cd frontend/main`

`$ npm install`

### Running the project:

`$ cd api`

`$ python main.py`

this will begin running the AI server required by the website's backend.

`$ cd frontend/main`

`$ npm run serve`

This will begin running the main web server. Now you can enter the website!

# Extra Info
also this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/arjuntejaswi/plant-village) contains all the plant images I used to train and test the AI. I didn't upload it to my github because this dataset is huge.
